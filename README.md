**What is driller**

*Driller* is simply an assistant that helps you perform ***"READ"*** queries on databases. In a human friendly way. 
The main goal once driller is added to a project is :
<br/>
For example : A SQL count query <br/>
`SELECT  COUNT(*) FROM user ` <br/>
would become <br/>
`how many user?`. <br/>
