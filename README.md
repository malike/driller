**What is driller**

*Driller* is simply an assistance that helps you perform ***"READ"*** queries on databases connected in a human 
way. The main goal is once driller is added to a project, anyone with no knowledge of database queries would be
able to run queries with ease.
<br/>
For example : A SQL count query <br/>
`SELECT  COUNT(*) FROM user `
would become
`how many user?`.

Databases integrated to work with driller are [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.org/),[MySQL]((https://www.mysql.com/)) and [ElasticSearch](https://www.elastic.co/products/elasticsearch).
